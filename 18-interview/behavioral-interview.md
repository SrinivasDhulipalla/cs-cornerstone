## How?

- During a behavioral interview, always listen carefully to the question, ask for clarification if necessary, and make sure you answer the question completely. When answering behavioral questions use the STAR Method and convey specific situations, actions, and outcomes/results.
	* **Situation**: Describe the situation that you were in, or the task that you needed to accomplish. Give ****enough detail**** for the interviewer to understand the ****complexities**** of the situation. This example can be from a previous job, school project, volunteer activity, or any relevant event.
	* **Task**: What goal were you working toward?
	* **Action Taken**: Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail, and keep the focus on ****you****. What specific ****steps**** did you take? What was your particular contribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project. Let us know what you actually did. Use the word “**I**,” not “we,” when describing actions.
	* **Results or Outcome**: Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about ****taking credit for your behavior****. What happened? How did the event ****end****? What did you ****accomplish****? What did you ****learn****? Provide examples using ****metrics or data**** if applicable.


**SITUATION/TASK** - Describe the situation/task you faced and the context of the story

* Answers the questions: **where** did this occur, **when** did it happen, **why** is it important?
* **Probing Questions**:
	* Why is this important? What was the goal?
	* What was the initial scope of the project? What were the challenges?
	* What were the risks and potential consequences if nothing happened?
* **Challenge Questions**:
	* Why did you choose this story to illustrate a xyz accomplishment?
	* What other stories can you think of that demonstrate…xyz?
	* Could you come up with an example that is more recent?

**ACTION** - What actions did you take?

* Answers the questions: what did you personally own, how did you do it, who else was involved?
* **Probing Questions**:
	* Deep probe functional expertise and/or assigned core competency.
	* Were you the key driver or project owner?
	* What was your biggest contribution? What unique value did you bring?
	* What were the most significant obstacles you faced? How did you overcome them?
* **Challenge Questions**:
	* What did you do specifically versus the team?
	* How did you set priorities…deal with xyz problem… or get manager buy-in?
	* What decisions did you challenge? Why? How did you influence the right outcome?

**RESULTS** - How did you measure success for this project? What results did you achieve?

* `$` Cost savings, revenue generation
* `#` Quantify to understand volume, size, scale
* `%` Percentage change, year over year improvements
* `ˆ` Time to market, implementation time, time savings
* `J` Impact on the customer, the team
* `d` Quality improvements
* **Probing Questions**:
	* Why did you choose to focus on these results? What other results were important?
	* You mentioned revenue, what percentage change is that year over year?
	* What trade-offs did you have to make to achieve this? (quality, cost, time)
	* I’m concerned about… (The time it took, the volume, the customer impact), tell me more…
* **Challenge Questions**:
	* What were the lessons learned? What would you have done differently?
	* How would you improve the process or result today?
	* How would you implement this at Amazon?
	* How did these results compare to your actual goals? (refer back to goal stated in Situation)
